# face-detect

This is a simple app that was built using react. 
The app has login, register, sign-in, and sign-out features. 

**TO USE**
**YOU CAN USE ANY INFO WHEN REGISTERING**
To use the app, sign-in or regitster, then copy and paste a direct link to an image. 
The app should detect the face and outline it with a blue box. 

Currently, the app is only able to detect a single face but I may update it in the future. 
I am also planning on adding a live detect feature that uses a webcam or a phone camera.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you find any errors. 

**REMEMBER** 
This is for demonstration purposes only and its features are limites.
